## Project Walkthrough

This is a simple minter example built on top of **Next.js 14** using some of [@mintbase-js](https://github.com/Mintbase/mintbase-js) packages.

_NOTE: As a standard on Bitte as we use the latest versions of Next.js we recommend using pnpm, but the package manager is up to your personal choice._

if you dont have a store you can [deploy a new contract](https://www.mintbase.xyz/launchpad/contracts/0) on our launchpad

## Pre-Setup - Proxy Contract

- You need to have a NEAR Contract where you add a proxy contract as a minter.
- The proxy contract enables non-minter users to mint images on your contract.
- The Near Contract will be where the NFT images will be minted.
- The proxy contract will be the minter.
- The user wallet address will be the owner of the NFT.

### Deploying a Near Contract on Mintbase:

1. Login on Mintbase and access [Contracts Page](https://www.mintbase.xyz/launchpad/contracts/0)
2. Click on New Contract
3. Choose Store Name (this will be the contract address to add on your minsta instance, this need to be added on the `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` environment variable) and Store Symbol
4. Proceed to transaction.
5. Succeeded
6. Go to Contract Settings

### Add Proxy Minter Contract

1. Under Contract Settings go to Minters
2. add `0.drop.proxy.mintbase.near` (this is the contract address that need to be added on `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROXY_MINTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`), and click Add Minters.
3. Proceed to transaction.
4. Succeeded

### Setup

In the `minter/src/config/setup.ts` file, we define several key configurations for interacting with the Mintbase platform. This setup is crucial for ensuring that our application communicates correctly with Mintbase smart contracts.

## ENV Variables

- `proxyAddress`: This is the address of the proxy contract on Mintbase. It is either taken from the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROXY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` or defaults to `"0.minsta.proxy.mintbase.testnet"` if the environment variable is not set.

- `contractAddress`: The address of the minting contract. Similar to `proxyAddress`, it is sourced from `NEXT_PUBLIC_MINT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` or defaults to `"test122212.mintspace2.testnet"`.

- `network`: Indicates the blockchain network we are interacting with. It defaults to `"testnet"` if `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK` is not specified in the environment.

- `callbackUrl`: A URL used for callbacks, constructed dynamically based on the `network` variable. If we are on the testnet, it uses the testnet URL; otherwise, it defaults to the mainnet URL.

To customize these configurations for different environments, you can set the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

`NOTE: the env variables need to have the NEXT_PUBLIC_ on the variable name due to be available for the browser to process`

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROXY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: Your proxy contract address on Mintbase.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MINT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: Your mint contract address on Mintbase.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK`: The network you want to interact with (`"testnet"` or `"mainnet"`).

after that you can run

```
pnpm install
```

and

```
pnpm dev
```

## Extending

This project is setup using Next.js + @mintbase/js + shadcn ui + react hook form
You can use this project as a reference to build your own, and use or remove any library you think it would suit your needs.
