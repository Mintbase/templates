# Hackaton Center @ EthBerlin04 - Powered by dRPC

### The problem Hackaton Center - Powered by dRPC solves

We wanted to create a cool collectible for hackaton enthusiasts that would evolve as they collect the Hackaton Poap's (QR for simplicity of the MVP) 
Each hackaton will have a POAP (QR for simplicity of the MVP) that will redirect to mint the NFT, if you have already have an NFT minted it will raise your level and evolve your NFT giving you a nice collectible NFT as a prize.
