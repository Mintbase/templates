# Mintbase.js Templates
[Mintbase templates](http://templates.mintbase.xyz) are a compilation of web3 project examples on Near Protocol, providing developers with starter projects and practical use cases. We invite diverse projects to submit demonstrations featuring their technology or developed using ours. Explore demos of existing templates, along with contribution guidelines and documentation to kickstart your journey below!

# GraphQL Indexer
You can use [our indexer playground](https://docs.mintbase.xyz/dev/mintbase-graph) to make your own complex queries that have been optimized for our own markets

## Contribution Guidelines

We're excited to invite you to contribute templates that showcase the capabilities of web3 projects on the Near Protocol. These templates can serve as starter projects for developers or exemplify specific use cases, inspiring real-world problem-solving. 

Here are some instructions to get started:

### Starter Guides

Before you start, take a look at these helpful starter guides to familiarize yourself with Mintbase technologies:

- [Add Wallet Connection to Your React App](https://docs.mintbase.xyz/dev/getting-started/add-wallet-connection-to-your-react-app)
- [Make Your First Contract Call and Deploy Contract](https://docs.mintbase.xyz/dev/getting-started/make-your-first-contract-call-deploycontract)
- [Upload Reference Material to Arweave and Mint](https://docs.mintbase.xyz/dev/getting-started/upload-reference-material-to-arweave-and-mint)
- [Get Blockchain Data (Owned Tokens)](https://docs.mintbase.xyz/dev/getting-started/get-blockchain-data-ownedtokens)

### Tech Docs

Explore the technologies used in building the current templates:

- **Indexer:** Get blockchain data using GraphQL [Mintbase Graph](https://docs.mintbase.xyz/dev/mintbase-graph)
- **@mintbase-js/sdk:** Interact with smart contracts in the simplest way [Getting Started](https://docs.mintbase.xyz/dev/getting-started)
- **@mintbase-js/wallet:** Add wallet connection to your app [Mintbase SDK Reference - Wallet](https://docs.mintbase.xyz/dev/mintbase-sdk-ref/wallet)
- **@mintbase-js/data:** Make it as easy as possible to get blockchain data [Mintbase SDK Reference - Data](https://docs.mintbase.xyz/dev/mintbase-sdk-ref/data)
- **@mintbase-js/storage:** Utilities for permanent storage like Arweave [Mintbase SDK Reference - Storage](https://docs.mintbase.xyz/dev/mintbase-sdk-ref/storage)

- **near-api-js** NEAR JavaScript API is a complete library to interact with the NEAR blockchain [Near API](https://github.com/near/)near-api-js
- **Official Near Docs** Explore the official SDKs provided by near protocol [Official Docs](https://docs.near.org/)

### Contribution Process

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/Mintbase/templates`
2. Start a new branch for your template
3. Create a new folder for your template within the branch
4. Add a README.MD following the guidelines below
5. Open a pull request
6. Ensure deployment works seamlessly

### Template Acceptance Criteria

For a greater chance of having your template accepted, it should meet the following criteria:

**Originality:** The template should feature original code and not be copied from existing sources. **Creating something new and unique is highly valued**; original contributions take precedence over duplicating existing content with minor modifications.

**Code Quality:** The code should be clean and easy to understand.

**README Format:** The template must respect the README format to be indexed by our system.

**Usefulness:** The example should either serve as a good platform to start a project or represent a use case/solve a problem.

# Project Name


Add a thumbnail to your project <img src="https://i.imgur.com/s9HSENw.jpg" alt="cover_image" width="0" />

## Description

The first sentence of the description is captured as the intro for the project and will be displayed on the mintbase landing page, use this to grab attention and get someone to click on your template.

Complete project description goes here. Explain the purpose, key features, or anything that provides context from both a business and technical perspective. This section should cover the 'what' and 'why' about the template, catering to users who may be deploying it for their business or developers looking to expand on it.

## Project Walkthrough

<img src="https://optional-detail-image.png" alt="detail_image" width="500"/>


Explain the project structure, key components, or any significant details. Provide step-by-step instructions for running the project locally.

## Deployment 

Deployment instructions. We include a link to deploy on vercel in every template because it makes it very easy for non developers to spin off their own tempaltes. This section is also a good place to speak about how to configure the project and environment variables.

It should be doable for someone that has no coding experience.
